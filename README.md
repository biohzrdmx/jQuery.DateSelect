jQuery.DateSelect
=================

There are a lot of date pickers out there, but why have an old and boring calendar when you can have a modern and slick date selector?

Meet DateSelect, a new way to select dates on your forms.

##Installing

Just grab the JS and CSS files, include them on your HTML file and you're set.

	<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/jquery.dateselect.css">

	<script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.dateselect.js"></script>

##Basic usage

This awesome plugin has two operation modes: automatic or manual.

###Automatic mode

In automatic mode you'll just have to add a `data-*` attribute and the plugin will do all the work (but for this to work, you must have also a valid HTML 5 DOCTYPE).

If you can't (or don't want to) add a DOCTYPE you can still use the good old `$('#input').dateSelect()` to bind your input fields.

**HTML**

	<input type="text" name="date1" id="date1" class="form-control" data-select="date">
	<span class="input-group-btn">
		<button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" data-toggle="select"><i class="fa fa-calendar"></i></button>
	</span>


###Manual mode

In manual mode, you'll have to call the `$.dateSelect.show()` method to open the date picker.

**HTML**

	<input type="text" name="date2" id="date2" class="form-control">
	<span class="input-group-btn">
		<button class="btn btn-primary btn-date" type="button"><i class="fa fa-calendar"></i></button>
	</span>

**JS**

	$('.btn-date').on('click', function(e) {
		e.preventDefault();
		$.dateSelect.show({
			element: 'input[name="date2"]'
		});
	});

###It's customizable

You may use the included stylesheet or style it to fit your page design. It's up to you!

###And it works with your mouse wheel too!

Just include the [jQuery MouseWheel](https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel) plugin and it will automagically make it work.

###So what do you need?

 - [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) 1.8+
 - [jQuery MouseWheel](https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel) plugin (optional)
 - A fairly modern web browser (Firefox, Chrome or Opera suggested. It should work on IE8+, but please stop supporting that crap)
 - A valid HTML 5 DOCTYPE (strongly recommended)

###Troubleshooting

As was said earlier, this works on Chrome, Firefox and Opera. IE8+ should work too, but we aren't officially supporting it (maybe IE10, but it's still a buggy, crappy browser; please let them die alone).

Safari shouldn't have any problem, after all it's just another webkit flavor.
